Describe a class where you felt your final grade in a course did not match with what you learned throughout the semester (this could be where your grade was “too low” or “too high”).
What do you think grades represent? What is your experience with grades?
If grades were removed from courses, what would you use for motivation? What value would learning have for you without grades?
Describe a time where you took the “easy way out” for an assignment. Why did you choose to go this route?

I recently took the Linear Algebra 3 course here at GVSU.  This class was one in which I learned a significant amount about abstract vector spaces and the related analysis to each space we observed.
